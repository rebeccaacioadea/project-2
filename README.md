## Project-2: <<< Weather Forecast >>>

## Overview 
This is my second project at General Assembly as a Software Engineer Immersive course's student. It was a pair programming 

The aim of this project is to build a "React application" that consumes a public API.

### Brief:

* Build a React Application
* Use a minimum of one public API
* Have Several components - At least one classic and one functional
* The application should incluse a router- with several pages
* Include wireframes 
* Have semantically clean HTML and 
* Be depoly online and accessible to the public

### Technologies:

* HTML5
* Bulma
* SCSS
* JavaScript
* React.js and JSX 
* Node Package Manager
* Babel Transpiler
* Webpack
* GitHub 
* GitHub Pages


## Functionality: 
* User is able to search for the weather in any city around the world
* The background of the card showing the weather forecast changes according to how hot/ cold the city is. 

## Approach taken:
We started the project by roughly thinking about the React Application we wanted to develop. 
We had to rougly draw out our plans, thinking in details of different components we wanted to have and the functionality that we needed for this project. And then:

1. I setted up the git respository on Github and then I added another collaborator onto the project to giev them access to it. 
2. We had only 48 hours to complete this projects. We started off by pair programming setting up the basic components and BrowserRouter for our application via *VSCode Liveshare*. 
3. Since there was not enough time, we separated work and I took charge of working on the navigation bars, weather forecast and city pages


## The WireFrame

## Endpoints
This project consist of two endpoints:

* Endpoint to access and manipulate the information for the weather forecast.
* The second endpoint was used when searching for the city.

## Components

## Potential future features

###  Problems 
The problem that occurred due to working in more than one componet at a time is that, we were faced with so much errors and we didn’t know where it was coming from, and on top of that every time I wanted to ‘console.log’ on chrome, my partner had to do it for me. The solution I came out with was, I copied the code for the components I was working on and commented out the code on my partner VS Code.  I use my own VScode to write the code, and chrome to test that it works properly before inserting the code back to our project. 
## Lessons learned

* Through this project. I have learnt that communication is vital when collaborating with others.
